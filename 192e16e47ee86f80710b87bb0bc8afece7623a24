I wouldn\u0027t mind tidying up the source lists further with some guidance, it\u0027s not entirely clear from the outside what is supposed to be \u0027public\u0027 of the older code, webm_parser is a bit tidier.\n\nTangentially; As part of packaging with Conan, I\u0027ve had to tackle building on Windows too unfortunately, and I\u0027m having some problems building it as a shared library (dll). Do you \u0027officially\u0027 support that configuration? Does it work there? The first issue I hit is that the build doesn\u0027t seem to generate a lib file to accompany the dll, indicating that no symbols are being exported. When I force all symbols to be exported with the cmake flag, I do get a lib file generated, but I then undefined symbol errors. Joy.",
