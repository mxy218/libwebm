      "message": "Hi James,\n\nWe\u0027ve run into some build issues with the latest XCode (15.01) when targeting \u003e\u003d C++20 because Apple have finally removed `result_type` and `argument_type` (among other things) which are used in webm_parser. These were deprecated in C++17 and then scheduled for removal in C++20.\n\nAFAIK this project targets C++11, so in this PR I\u0027ve kept backwards compatibility by using a feature detection macro to fallback to the current use of `result_type` when the newer replacement code is not available.\n\nI felt that keeping the `argument_type` alias could be misleading since this has been removed from the standard, so I removed this under the belief that it\u0027s best to write for the newest standard possible when it won\u0027t break backwards compatibility. \n\nI would have liked to remove `result_type` too but I think keeping it makes the backwards compatibility tidier. I considered making the `result_type` alias private in the post-C++17 code to alleviate some of my concerns about it being misleading, but again I thought this made the backwards compatibility code messier, I don\u0027t feel strongly about this though.\n\nThanks in advance for reviewing!",
