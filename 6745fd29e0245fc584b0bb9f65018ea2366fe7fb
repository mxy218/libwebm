      "message": "This `srand(*seed)` call is incorrect. The `seed` argument is the address of `Segment::seed_`. Because of this `srand(*seed)` call, all the `MakeUID()` calls made by the same `Segment` object will return the same uid value for `__MINGW32__`.\n\nThis bug was introduced in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/webm/libwebm/+/68497.\n\nThe `srand(seed_)` call in the `Segment` constructor was added in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/webm/libwebm/+/41944. But that `srand(seed_)` call was also incorrect -- it was added along with the MSVCRT `rand_s()` call in `MakeUID()`, but `rand_s()` doesn\u0027t use the seed generated by `srand()`.\n\nThe `rand_s()` call was changed to a `rand()` call in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/webm/libwebm/+/70916. At this point the `srand(seed_)` call in the `Segment` constructor became correct and useful.",
