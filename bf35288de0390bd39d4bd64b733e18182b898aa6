      "message": "I think the weirdness is the missed instance of length-\u003eframe_length. I forgot to run it after the last pass through here; that\u0027s fixed now.\n\nI\u0027m not following the comment about the total read length, but I think it\u0027s probably me: rebased this patch and the next about 5 times already today, and I\u0027ve had enough of three way diffs for today. \n\nFw(little)iw, run time behavior appears correct now, but I don\u0027t have tests that prove anything. Going to pull gtest into libwebm soon; tired of this situation.",
